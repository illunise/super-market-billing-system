The Shopping Mall Billing System is a C++ project that simulates the process of billing at a shopping mall. It allows the user to show the items in mall, calculate the total cost of the items, and generate a receipt. The program makes use of various C++ concepts such as classes, objects, and file handling to create a realistic simulation of a shopping mall billing system. The user can choose to purchase multiple items and the system will keep track of the total cost and will generate a receipt at the end of the transaction with the items and their prices listed. Additionally, it also can handle the discounts at the end of the checkout which makes it more like real-life billing process.

In addition to the basic shopping functionality, the Shopping Mall Billing System also includes an admin login option. This feature allows an administrator to access a separate section of the program where they can add, modify, and delete products that are available for purchase. The admin login uses a password-based authentication system to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the product management functionality.
With this option, the administrator can easily keep the inventory updated and provide the customers with new products by adding them to the system. Also, the administrator can remove or update the products from the inventory if required. It's a simple yet powerful tool for managing the products available at the mall.
This feature provides added flexibility and control for managing the products available for purchase, and make the system more realistic and efficient in a real-world scenario.
